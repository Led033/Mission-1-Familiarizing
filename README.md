## Mission-1: Familiarizing

Things I learned while figuring out repositories:
1. I learned how to automatically add a README.md to the repository right off the bat when making it so it doesn't need to be added later.
2. I also figured out how to change the formating (spacing, indent size, and wrap) of the text for visuals.
3. I learned how to preview, commit and cancel chnages that are made when editing a repository (very helpful)!
